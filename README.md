🛡️ Obstacle Avoiding Robot for Mining
An autonomous robot designed to navigate hazardous mining environments by detecting and avoiding obstacles in real time. This project enhances safety and exploration efficiency by minimizing human exposure to dangerous zones.

🚀 Features
🤖 Autonomous navigation without human intervention.
🚧 Real-time obstacle detection and rerouting.
🛠️ Rugged build for rough mining environments.
🔌 Expandable with sensors like gas detectors, temperature sensors, and cameras.
⚙️ Components Used
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno / Raspberry Pi
Sensors: Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Motor Driver: L298N Motor Driver Module
Motors: DC Geared Motors with Wheels
Power: Rechargeable Battery Pack
Chassis: Reinforced Frame (metallic or high-grade plastic)
Other: Jumper wires, connectors
🛠️ How It Works
Sense: Ultrasonic sensors scan the environment for obstacles.
Process: Microcontroller calculates distance from obstacles.
Act: If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the robot changes its direction.
Navigate: Continuously adapts its path to avoid collisions and proceed safely.
